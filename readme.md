Currently, I use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for colorize terminal and short aliases for the git interface and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) as a text editor. Also, use few useful shell scripts to automate routine. From time to time I will update this repo and save some useful plugins and commands.

## oh-my-zsh

This wonderful framework has an amazing [plugin](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#plugins) system and in my opinion should be extended via user plugins (the personal ones).

## sublime text

What can I say? I like it :) Simple and flexible.

Most of all the available packages can be found through the website: https://packagecontrol.io/
I'll mention some of my favorite ones below.

### settings

```javascript
{ "keys": ["super+shift+b"], "command": "reveal_in_side_bar" },
```

## Desires

The current codebase is outdated and should be updated. I wish to automate installation of *oh-my-zsh* and provide few commands to fetch plugins from different sources. Also put the global configs for git and sublime packages.
